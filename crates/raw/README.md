# photocraft-raw

A clean-room, pure-Rust camera raw decoder and developer. The crate is standalone (no workspace
dependencies), has no `unsafe`, does no I/O (`&[u8]` in), builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
(sequential there, rayon-parallel on native) and never panics on hostile input: every offset is
bounds-checked and sizes are checked against `Limits` before allocating.

```rust
use photocraft_raw::{develop, DevelopOptions, Demosaic};

let dev = develop(&bytes, &DevelopOptions { demosaic: Demosaic::Ahd, ..Default::default() })?;
// dev.rgb: interleaved 16-bit RGB in ProPhoto RGB (ROMM primaries, D50, gamma 1.8)
// dev.warnings: anything approximated or not applied
```

`photocraft-io` uses it so opening a raw file yields a normal 16-bit RGB document tagged with the
built-in ProPhoto-compatible profile.

## Sources (clean-room)

Implemented only from public specifications, papers and observation of files:

* TIFF 6.0, TIFF/EP (ISO 12234-2) and the Adobe DNG Specification 1.7.
* ITU-T T.81 (ISO 10918-1) Annex H: lossless JPEG, process 14 ("LJ92").
* The published description of Canon's CR2 container (header, raw IFD, slice tag 0xC640).
* Publicly documented maker-note / private tags: Canon SensorInfo (0x00E0) and ColorData
  (0x4001), Nikon WB_RBLevels (0x000C) and BlackLevel (0x003D), Sony BlackLevel (0x7310) and
  WB_RGGBLevels (0x7313).
* Demosaicing: Malvar, He & Cutler (ICASSP 2004); Hirakawa & Parks, "Adaptive
  homogeneity-directed demosaicing" (IEEE TIP 2005).
* McCamy's CCT approximation (1992); the Bradford chromatic adaptation transform.

No code from dcraw, LibRaw, rawspeed, rawler, rawloader or darktable was read or used, and no
camera colour tables were copied.

## Support matrix

| Format | Status |
|---|---|
| DNG | Uncompressed (8–16 bit, packed or not) and lossless JPEG; strips and tiles; CFA (Bayer) and LinearRaw; LinearizationTable, BlackLevel (+ repeat, DeltaH/V), WhiteLevel, ActiveArea, DefaultCrop, ColorMatrix1/2, CameraCalibration, ForwardMatrix, AnalogBalance, AsShotNeutral / AsShotWhiteXY, BaselineExposure, Orientation, OpcodeList2 GainMap (lens shading) |
| DNG (lossy JPEG, JPEG XL, floating point; opcodes other than GainMap) | Unsupported / not applied (reported) |
| CR2 | Lossless JPEG with slices, borders and as-shot white balance from the maker note, black measured on the masked border |
| CR2 sRAW / mRAW | Unsupported |
| NEF / NRW, ARW, PEF and other TIFF/EP raws | Uncompressed and lossless-JPEG (incl. Sony lossless ARW) CFA data |
| Nikon compressed NEF, Sony compressed ARW, Pentax compressed PEF | Unsupported (vendor compression; `photocraft-io` opens the embedded JPEG preview instead) |
| CR3, RAF, ORF, RW2 | Recognised, unsupported (preview fallback where a preview is found) |
| X-Trans and other non-Bayer CFAs | Unsupported |

## Development pipeline

1. Linearization table, per-position black level, scale to the white level.
2. White balance (as shot; or grey-world when the file has none; or explicit multipliers),
   normalized so the smallest multiplier is 1, then clip to 1 so blown highlights stay white.
3. Demosaic: `Bilinear`, `Mhc` (Malvar–He–Cutler) or `Ahd` (default).
4. Camera → XYZ (D50) per the DNG specification (ColorMatrix interpolated by the white's
   correlated colour temperature, or ForwardMatrix), → linear ProPhoto; exposure
   (BaselineExposure + user EV); gamma 1.8; 16 bits.
5. Orientation.

Files without colour calibration (CR2, NEF, ARW…) use a documented neutral fallback: the
white-balanced camera channels are treated as linear sRGB primaries (colours are plausible but
less saturated than a calibrated profile; converting to DNG gives calibrated colour). No tone
curve is applied: the result is a scene-referred rendering, flatter than a camera JPEG.

## Tools

`cargo run --release -p photocraft-raw --example rawinfo -- [--dump] [--demosaic ahd] [--png DIR] FILE...`
prints what was decoded, times decode and develop, and can write sRGB PNG previews and the
embedded JPEG previews.
